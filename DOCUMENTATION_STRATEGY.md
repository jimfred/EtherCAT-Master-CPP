# Documentation Strategy

## File Responsibilities

### ðŸ“– **README.md** - "User Manual"
**Target:** New users, quick reference  
**Content:** 
- What the project does
- How to build and run
- Basic usage instructions
- Prerequisites and troubleshooting
**Maintenance:** Update when features/usage changes

### ðŸ“š **DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md** - "Developer Context"  
**Target:** Developers, future maintainers, AI assistants  
**Content:**
- Why architectural decisions were made
- Development insights and lessons learned
- Technical implementation context
- Future enhancement ideas
**Maintenance:** Add entries when making significant changes

### âš¡ **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - "Cheat Sheet"
**Target:** Regular users, quick lookup  
**Content:**
- Essential commands and usage
- Which app does what
- Common troubleshooting
- Key insights summary
**Maintenance:** Sync with README when commands change

## Avoiding Duplication

### Single Source of Truth Principle
- **Build commands:** Only in README.md
- **Application descriptions:** Only in README.md  
- **Architectural decisions:** Only in DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md
- **Technical insights:** Only in DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md
- **Quick lookup:** Only in QUICK_REFERENCE.md

### Cross-References Instead of Duplication
- Use links: `[see README.md](README.md)` instead of copying content
- Reference specific sections: `[Build Instructions](README.md#building)`
- Keep context pointers: `"For the reasoning behind this, see DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md"`

## Maintenance Strategy

### When Updating Features:
1. **Primary update:** README.md (user-facing changes)
2. **Context update:** DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md (why the change was made)
3. **Quick reference:** QUICK_REFERENCE.md (if commands changed)

### When Adding Insights:
1. **Primary update:** DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md (insights, lessons learned)
2. **Reference:** Add pointer from README.md if user-relevant

This strategy eliminates redundancy while preserving all valuable context.
